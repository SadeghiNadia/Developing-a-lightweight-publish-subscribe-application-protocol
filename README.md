# MQTT Publish-Subscribe Protocol Simulation with TOSSIM

This project implements a lightweight MQTT-style publish-subscribe communication protocol using TOSSIM, a discrete event simulator for TinyOS networks.

## üîß Project Overview

- Designed a simplified broker-client communication flow.
- Simulated message subscription, connection, and basic publishing.
- Focused on demonstrating core protocol logic in a time-constrained academic setting.

## üí° Tools Used
- TOSSIM
- Python scripting for interaction logic
- TinyOS simulation environment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
Due to time constraints, this implementation focuses on foundational messaging logic. Full-scale reliability and robustness were not the primary objective.
